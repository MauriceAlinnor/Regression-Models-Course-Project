# Regression-Models-Course-Project

This project looks at a data set of a collection of cars in order to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). There is interest in the following two questions:

“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”

"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

Data is got from the mtcars dataset in R.
